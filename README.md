## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

In this project, I focus on three business problems and predicted the reservation price using the KNN machine learning algorithm regarding the Los Angeles Airbnb Sep.2019 dataset.
Particullary I have three questions to while looks throught the data:

1.What are the busiest times of the year to visit Los Angeles?
2.How is the reservation price affected by the neighborhood?
3.Which are the most relevant features on house rental prices?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
There is a notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.
The notebooks contains my steps for making the conclusion based on the data analysis of factors affecting the reservation prices. Detail explanations are included to help  you walking throught process.

## Results<a name="results"></a>
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@mainemayjane/los-angeles-airbnb-reservation-price-analysis-sep-2019-66aa3dc984c5).
