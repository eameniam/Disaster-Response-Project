## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
In this project, I am using the ETL, NLp and ML pipeline to deal with real messages from Figure Eight.

•	Using the disaster data set containing real messages sent during natural disaster via disaster response organizations from Figure Eight to build a model for an API that classifies disaster messages
•	Building up a ETL pipeline for processing message and category data from csv files and load them into a SQLite database. Using machine learning pipeline which categorize the events and save a multi-output supervised.


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
There are two notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.
The notebooks contains my steps for making the conclusion based on the data analysis of factors affecting the reservation prices. Detail explanations are included to help  you walking throught process.
And there are three folder, the data included the data processing ETL, and the model folder included the ML pipeline model.
